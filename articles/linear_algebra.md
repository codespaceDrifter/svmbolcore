a vector is a ordered list of expressions  

a vector space is a set of vectors that is a closure under addition and scalor mulitplication, and the usual rules of communativity, associativity, and distributivity apply  

vector space:  
i.e. real number n-tuples. i.e. (4,2,5,6) , (1,6,7,8)  
i.e. matrixes M nm  
i.e. complex number n-tuples  
i.e. continuous real valued functions on closed interval  

formal requirements for a vector space:  
1. communitavity: $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}$
2. associativity: $(\vec{a} + \vec{b}) + \vec{c} = \vec{a} + (\vec{b} + \vec{c})$  
(communativity means left and right operand cannot be switched  
associative means that in a chain of same operations it doesn't matter which one is done first  
matmuls are associative but not communitive, averaging is communitive but not associative)
3. additive identity: $\vec{0} + \vec{x} = \vec{x}$  
4. additive inverses: $\vec{x} + (-\vec{x}) = 0$  
5. vector distributivity: $a(\vec{x}+\vec{y}) = a\vec{x} + b \vec{y}$  
6. scalar distributivity: $(a+b)\vec{x} = a\vec{x} + b\vec{x}$  
7. multiplicative identity: $1\vec{x} = \vec{x}$
8. scalar multiplication associativity: $ab\vec{x} = a(b\vec{x})$

the simpler proof of a vector space:
1. prove or know it's a subspace of another vector space
2. prove it's closed under addition (with variable values)
3. prove it's closed under multiplication (with variable values)

i.e. polynomial functions is a subspace of continuous functions (infinite terms)
