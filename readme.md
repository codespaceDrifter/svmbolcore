math library that symbolically solve algebra
code in python first maybe switch to c++ later  

to do:
auto insert multiplication in parse i.e. 3a -> interpreted as 3*a
expression simplification
equation solving
calculus
integrate with c++ nvnopara (delete nvnopara move to here)
linear algebra operations (maybe during school quater)

i should be able to USE this project IN phvsicsim and phvsicsim should NOT touch CUDA and just CALL this. 

task to do (simplification):
if ^ symbol meets a another operator and a number, expand it into * symbols
if meeting
