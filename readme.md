math library that symbolically solve algebra
code in python first maybe switch to c++ later  

to do:
expression simplification
equation solving
calculus
integrate with c++ nvnopara (delete nvnopara move to here)
linear algebra operations (maybe during school quater)

i should be able to USE this project IN phvsicsim and phvsicsim should NOT touch CUDA and just CALL this.
